			<h1>We happy?</h1>

				Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but
				you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I
				don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case,
				it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit
				this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
			</p>
			<h1>No man, I don't eat pork</h1>
			<p>
				Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called
				a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on
				the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more
				shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
				don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became
				nothing.
			</p>
			<h1>I'm serious as a heart attack</h1>
			<p>
				You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
				mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder.
				After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know
				exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us
				survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath,
				that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
				other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle
				to man.
			</p>
			<h1>Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!</h1>
			<p>
				Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it
				right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house,
				fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
				better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm
				sayin'?
			</p>
			<h1>Are you ready for the truth?</h1>
			<p>
				Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
				clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
				Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
				mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well,
				that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy
				store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
			</p>
			<h1>Hold on to your butts</h1>

			<h1>I gotta piss</h1>
			<p>
				Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
				bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do.
				That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
				way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our
				lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and
				I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
			</p>
			<h1>I gotta piss</h1>
			<p>
				Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This
				gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you
				believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
				with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually
				proud of that shit.
			</p>
			<h1>Is she dead, yes or no?</h1>
			<p>
				The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of
				the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name
				of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
				darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost
				children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and
				furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
				And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
